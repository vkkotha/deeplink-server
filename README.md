# node-js-sample

A small poc that demos opening links with mobile apps with universal linking and deeplinking support.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js 6+](http://nodejs.org/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vkkotha/deeplink-server.git
cd deeplink-server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

Access the app from a mobile device on the same network using your machine ipaddress or name.
